In this paper, a personalized recommender system is
proposed for the online store of SuperValu which currently lacks
one. The front-end design of the website has a lot of white spaces
and a recommendation widget can be easily accommodated on
every web page. The content of the recommendation widget
would change in accordance with the web page being currently
viewed. To achieve this functionality and tackle the humongous
amount and variety of products found in such an online grocery
store, a combination of data mining techniques, content-based,
collaborative-filtering and knowledge-based recommendation
approaches have been used to. To set the online SuperValu store
apart from other competitors, a component that suggests recipes
to consumers is built into the recommender system as well.
